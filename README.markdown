Chris's Dot Files
=================

To install download or clone the project to where you would like to store it.  I keep things in ~/.dotfiles, for fun.

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/csexton/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake symlink
</pre>

My vim configuration
--------------------

While the rc files are pretty haphazard, I have actually spent some time on the vim files.  I don't keep anything in my .vimrc file, instead I use a plugin/risto.vim file that fills that role. Normally I just touch .vimrc and leave it be.  The only exception is if I need something specific to a machine.
